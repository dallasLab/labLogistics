## labLogistics

This repository contains information pertinent to the folks working in the Dallas lab at University of South Carolina. Much of the material is _borrowed_ from numerous great folks, who are credited at the end of this document, and in documents within this repo. 


Files containing relevant lab philosophy and mentoring statements are on the top-level (`onboarding`, `mentoring`, `codeOfConduct`, and `wiki`). 

`manuscriptTemplate` is a useful (or not?) template for writing manuscripts using LaTeX. 

`beamerTemplate` is a useful (or not?) template for writing presentations using LaTeX. 

`protocolTemplate` is a useful (or not?) template for developing lab protocols using LaTeX. 

`experimentTemplate` is a useful (or not?) template for developing experimental protocols using LaTeX (I expect that each study you work on will have an associated one of these)
