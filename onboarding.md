These are just notes for myself to make sure I hit all these points when bringing a new student into the lab. 


+ An official welcome
+ Background on me and the lab
+ Point to Github about my expectations (and highlight the main ones)
+ Discuss the student's expectations of me
+ Weekly one-on-one meetings plus lab meeting
+ Accessibility through email or office visits
+ Lab notebooks (how to maintain, where it lives, etc.)
+ Tour of lab space (including computational resources)
+ Talk about potential research projects
+ Discuss the lab Github, protocols, and useful lab skills
+
